/*Notes:
a) Dynamic initialization is that in which initialization value isn't known at compile-time. It's computed at runtime to initialize the variable.
b) ยง3.6.2/1 from the C++ Standard (2003) says,
Objects with static storage duration (3.7.1) shall be zero-initialized (8.5) before any other initialization takes place. Zero-initialization and initialization with a constant expression are collectively called static initialization; all other initialization is dynamic initialization.*/

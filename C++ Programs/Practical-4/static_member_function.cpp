/*
When we declare a member of a class as static it means no matter how many objects of the class are created, there is only one copy of the static member.

Important points about Static :

1) A static member is shared by all objects of the class, all static data is initialized to zero when the first object is created, if no other initialization is present.
2) A static member function can only access static data member, other static member functions and any other functions from outside the class.
3) By declaring a function member as static, we make it independent of any particular object of the class. A static member function can be called even if no objects of the class exist and the static functions are accessed using only the class name and the scope resolution operator :: .
4) We canâ€™t put it in the class definition but it can be initialized outside the class as done in the following example by re-declaring the static variable, using the scope resolution operator :: to identify which class it belongs to.
